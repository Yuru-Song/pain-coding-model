# pain-coding-model

Codes for part of the simulations in the manuscript "Predictive coding models for pain perception".

figure_4.py is to generate figures in Fig.4 

figure_5.py and figure_6.py are to generate simulation results in Fig.5 and Fig.6 respectively, and save them in .mat format files for later plotting. Note these programs require heavy computation.

plot_fig_5.m and plot_fig_6.m are corresponding matlab codes for plotting Fig.5 and Fig.6 .

Please put all these files in the same folder.
